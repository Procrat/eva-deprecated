# Eva - Eva Virtual Assistant

Your own free personal assistant


## About

Eva aims to be an application with a personality to manage your life when you
don't feel like doing that yourself.
It currently does this by managing your todo-list, but hopefully it will soon
enough become an agenda / scheduler / focus booster / reminder, all in one.

It borrows from various productivity and motivation concepts like GTD,
Pomodoro, the Eisenhower scheme, flow, focussing on one task, small-chunking
work, eating the frog, etc.


## Installation

Soon `setup.py` will cover dependencies, but for now please install
dependencies manually.

### Linux

Make sure `libnotify` and `at` are installed. Also make sure the `at` daemon is
running (and started on boot).

### Mac OS

Not fully supported yet.


## Usage

At the moment you can just run `main.py` using Python 3.
