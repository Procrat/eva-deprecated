# Deprecated in favor of [the new Eva](https://github.com/Procrat/eva)

This project made a lot of interesting progress and was nice to use but was
ultimately missing the core features to actually start using this instead of
other tools. The [new Eva](https://github.com/Procrat/eva) implements just that.
The idea is that most of the code in this repo will at some point use the new
code as a library.


# Eva - Eva Virtual Assistant    [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/Procrat/eva-deprecated.png?branch=bulk-editing)](https://travis-ci.org/Procrat/eva-deprecated)

## Installation

Soon `setup.py` will cover dependencies, but for now please install
dependencies manually.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Linux

Make sure `libnotify` and `at` are installed. Also make sure the `at` daemon is
running (and started on boot).

### Mac OS

Run `pip install -r requirements_osx.txt`


## Usage

At the moment you can just run `main.py` using Python 3.
