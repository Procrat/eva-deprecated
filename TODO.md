# TODO

## Short term ideas
- Notifications
- Reminders
- Capture everything: recurring tasks
- Scheduling
- Reflect: overview, progress
- What do you wanna do (or have done) today?
- How much work can you do in a day?
- Project or single task?
    - Project: Divide in smaller steps
    - Single task: add to todo-list
    - Less than two minutes: now
    - Delegatable? -> Waiting for-task
    - How long will it take? + How important (pos impact) is it?
        + How urgent is it? Deadline?
        -> Schedule (with google agenda?)
- Choose task to do NOW (eat the frog)
- Pomodoro (single task)
    - Reschedule stuff when other things get in the way
    - Ask why you stopped doing something


## Long term ideas
- Labels
- Bulk edit with favorite editor
- Link met life goals? goal/project/task dependencies?
    - 10y-plan -> 5y-plan -> 2y-plan -> 1y-plan -> 1m-plan -> ...
    - Backwards planning
- Visualize outcome?
- Public commitment / announcement? (Don't know if this can be tied in with the
  application yet)
- See if http://pyjs.org/Overview.html is any good
- Maybe use https://github.com/Robpol86/terminaltables for the agenda
- Make backups, both locally and on a server


## Concepts to bear in mind
- Make it personalized
- Flow (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29)
- Positive thinking (positive comments / Enjoy!)
- No multitasking; do one thing and do it right
- Capture quickly, so you can continue your flow
- Reflect at systematic intervals
- Urgent interruption -> notes to remember where you were
- Reflect:
    - Prioritize (what do you wanna do today?)
    - Delegate (what can be done by someone else?)
- Schedule (did something get a deadline?)
    - Did something become irrelevant / done / done by someone else?
    - Necessary for flow:
    - Goals are clear
    - Feedback is immediate
    - A balance between opportunity and capacity
- “Always remember, your focus determines your reality.”
